Work challenges can arise from a variety of sources, such as changing market conditions, shifting customer needs, or internal process inefficiencies. To effectively address these challenges, it's important to prioritize them for resolution based on their impact and urgency.

Identifying Work Challenges

2. Conduct the SWOT analysis: Conducting a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis can help identify potential challenges and the context in which they arise.

3. Analyze data: Analyze data from customer feedback, sales trends, and internal processes to identify potential challenges.

By utilizing these strategies, individuals and organizations can effectively identify work challenges and the context in which they arise.

Prioritizing Problems for Resolution
